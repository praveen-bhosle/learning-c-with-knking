Precendence and associativity 
The operators have a precendence order 
+ -  unary 
* /  binary 
+ -  binary 

i + j * k -> i + ( j * k ) 
-i * -j -> (-i) * (-j) 
+i + j / k -> (+i) + (j/k) 

For operators on same level ,  like * / we will use associativity rules.

An  operator is said to be left associative if it groups from left to right. 
Eg : * , / 
     + , - [ binary] 
i * j / k  is equal to ( i * j ) / k 

If an operator is right associative it groups from right to left. 
Eg> + , - [ unary ] 

- - i  -> - (- i)
