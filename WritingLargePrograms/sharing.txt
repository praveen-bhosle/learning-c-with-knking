To share a function we have define the function in one file and files that want this function will just declare it.

It is similiar for variables , we will use extern keyword. 
The main file in which the variable will be have declaration + definition. 
In the files where we will access this variable we will just use the declaration with the extern keyword. 

When declarations of the same variable appear in different files, the compiler can’t check that the declarations match the variable’s definition. 
For example, one file may contain the definition
int i;
while another file contains the declaration
extern long i;
An error of this kind can cause the program to behave unpredictably.

So we put the declarations of shared variables in the header files.
