scenario:
main.c includes file1.h and file2.h 
both file1.h and file2.h include file3.h 
So when main.c will be complied file3.h will be compiled twice.
This will lead to issues if file3.h contains type definitions.

This can be avoided using #ifndef-#endif pair.

The first time u include the file the content inside ifndef-endif will be included 
but for second time the content inside ifndef-endif will be skipped.
