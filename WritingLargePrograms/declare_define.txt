declaring a var : declaring a varible's name and its type. 
defining a var : setting aside space for i.

int i ; 
it will decale a variable i with type int and as well define it by setting aside space for it. 

we can use the keyword extern to just declare the variable and not defining it. 
Adding extern does not sets aside space for the variable.

int  a[] ; does not work , because here the compiler does not know how much space to set aside for a.
extern  int a[] ; works fine because we are not assigning any space to a we have just declared it. 
extern tells compiler that 'a' is defined somewhere else so no need to allocate any memory for it.
