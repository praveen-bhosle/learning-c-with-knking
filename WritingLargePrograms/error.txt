#error directives are often put in header files to check for conditions under
which the header file shouldn’t be included. For example, suppose that a header
file uses a feature that didn’t exist prior to the original C89 standard. To prevent the
header file from being used with older, nonstandard compilers, it could contain an
#ifndef directive that tests for the existence of the __STDC__ macro:
#ifndef __STDC__
#error This header requires a Standard C compiler
#endif
